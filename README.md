# Thesis 2023

## Plan

### August 2022
- check formula
- try simple AE with structure according to formula

### September 2022
- baseline: simple AE
- small improvements of the model

- add bias to linear layers
- add activation to the model output
- experiments on reduction of ratings dimension: simple average, linear layer, take only the highest rating

### Future
- visualization for monitoring
- move to sparse format
- add denoising techniques


## Materials
- learn orthogonal matrices: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06496.pdf
